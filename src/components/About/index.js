        I am a passionate graphic design student with a keen eye for aesthetics and a drive for creativity.

        <p>
          As a student, I have been studying graphic design for 2 years and have developed a strong foundation in design principles, typography, color theory, and layout. I am constantly exploring new design trends and techniques to expand my skill set and stay up to date with the ever-evolving industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am enthusiastic about the opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to the world of design. If you're interested in collaborating or have any design-related inquiries, please feel free to get in touch!
